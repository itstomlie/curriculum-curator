# üöÄ Quick Test Instructions

## Your React app is starting up!

The React development server is now running. Here's how to test:

### 1. **Check if React is working**
Open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

You should see the Curriculum Curator interface!

### 2. **If you see errors about missing modules**
That's expected! The app tries to connect to the API server which isn't running yet.

### 3. **Test with Simple API**
Open a new terminal and run this simple test server:

```bash
python3 -c "
from http.server import HTTPServer, BaseHTTPRequestHandler
import json

class Handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header('Content-type', 'application/json')
        self.send_header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*')
        self.end_headers()
        
        if self.path == '/health':
            response = {'status': 'healthy', 'message': 'Test API running'}
        elif self.path == '/api/workflows':
            response = {
                'config_workflows': {},
                'predefined_workflows': {
                    'test_workflow': {
                        'name': 'test_workflow', 
                        'description': 'A test workflow for demonstration'
                    }
                }
            }
        elif self.path == '/api/workflows/sessions':
            response = []
        else:
            response = {'message': 'Test endpoint'}
            
        self.wfile.write(json.dumps(response).encode())

print('üåê Test API server running on http://localhost:8000')
print('‚úÖ Visit http://localhost:8000/health to test')
HTTPServer(('localhost', 8000), Handler).serve_forever()
"
```

### 4. **Expected Results**

With both servers running:
- **React**: http://localhost:3000 - Should show the Curriculum Curator UI
- **API**: http://localhost:8000/health - Should show {"status": "healthy"}

### 5. **Success Indicators**

‚úÖ **React app loads** - You see the sidebar with Dashboard, Workflows, etc.
‚úÖ **No console errors** - Check browser developer tools
‚úÖ **API connection works** - Dashboard shows "API Status: Healthy"
‚úÖ **Navigation works** - You can click between pages

### 6. **If there are still issues**

Try the simplified version:
```bash
# In web/src/index.tsx, change line 4 to:
import App from './App-simple';
```

Then refresh the browser. You should see a simple "Curriculum Curator" page.

## üéâ Next Steps

Once React is working, you can:
1. Install the full Python dependencies
2. Run the complete development environment: `python run-dev.py`
3. Test the Electron wrapper: `cd electron && npm run electron-dev`

**The fact that npm start is running means your setup is working!** üéâ
