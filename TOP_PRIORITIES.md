# Implementation Priorities and Progress

Based on the project design and architecture, these are the critical components of the system.

## âœ… Completed Priorities

### âœ… 1. Prompt Registry

**Status**: COMPLETED

The Prompt Registry forms the foundation of the system, managing prompt storage, loading, and access. Achievements:
- Implemented the PromptRegistry class with metadata support
- Added caching for performance optimization
- Created sample prompts for different educational content types
- Added validation of required variables

### âœ… 2. LLM Integration Layer

**Status**: COMPLETED

The LLM Integration Layer provides a unified interface to language models. Achievements:
- Completed the LLMManager implementation
- Added support for multiple LLM providers
- Implemented token counting and cost calculation
- Added retry logic and error handling

### âœ… 3. Workflow Engine

**Status**: COMPLETED

The Workflow Engine orchestrates the entire content generation process. Achievements:
- Implemented the core Workflow and WorkflowStep classes
- Created specific step types (PromptStep, ValidationStep, RemediationStep, OutputStep)
- Added context management and session persistence
- Implemented error handling and recovery
- Created a sample end-to-end workflow for educational content generation

## ðŸš€ Current Priorities

### 1. Output Production System

**Justification**: The output system needs to be implemented to support various formats:
- Support for multiple output formats (HTML, PDF, DOCX, slides)
- Customizable templates for different educational contexts
- Metadata handling for better organization

**Next steps**:
- Implement OutputManager for format conversion
- Add Pandoc integration for rich document formats
- Create templates for different educational content types

### 2. Enhanced Documentation

**Justification**: With many components now implemented, comprehensive documentation is essential:
- API reference documentation for developers
- User guides for content creators
- Architectural overview for contributors

**Next steps**:
- Set up MkDocs for documentation generation
- Create comprehensive API reference
- Write detailed tutorials for common workflows

### 3. Web Interface

**Justification**: A web interface would make the system more accessible:
- Visual workflow builder for non-technical users
- Interactive content preview and editing
- Dashboard for monitoring workflow execution

**Next steps**:
- Create a basic web dashboard using FastHTML and HTMX
- Implement workflow visualization
- Add content preview functionality

## ðŸŒŸ Milestone Achieved: MVP Workflow

We have successfully implemented a minimum viable product workflow that can:
1. Generate complete educational modules including:
   - Course overview
   - Module outlines
   - Lecture content
   - Worksheets with activities
   - Assessments with various question types
   - Instructor guides with teaching suggestions
2. Validate content quality
3. Remediate issues automatically
4. Generate formatted output files
5. Track usage and costs

This MVP workflow demonstrates the core functionality of the system and provides a foundation for further development.
