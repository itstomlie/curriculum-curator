# Implementation Priorities and Progress

Based on the project design and architecture, these are the critical components of the system.

## âœ… Completed Priorities

### âœ… 1. Prompt Registry

**Status**: COMPLETED

The Prompt Registry forms the foundation of the system, managing prompt storage, loading, and access. Achievements:
- Implemented the PromptRegistry class with metadata support
- Added caching for performance optimization
- Created sample prompts for different educational content types
- Added validation of required variables

### âœ… 2. LLM Integration Layer

**Status**: COMPLETED

The LLM Integration Layer provides a unified interface to language models. Achievements:
- Completed the LLMManager implementation
- Added support for multiple LLM providers
- Implemented token counting and cost calculation
- Added retry logic and error handling

### âœ… 3. Workflow Engine

**Status**: COMPLETED

The Workflow Engine orchestrates the entire content generation process. Achievements:
- Implemented the core Workflow and WorkflowStep classes
- Created specific step types (PromptStep, ValidationStep, RemediationStep, OutputStep)
- Added context management and session persistence
- Implemented error handling and recovery
- Created a sample end-to-end workflow for educational content generation

## ðŸš€ Current Priorities

### 1. Validation Framework Enhancement

**Justification**: The validation system needs to be expanded to handle a wider range of quality checks:
- Additional validators for specialized educational content
- Performance improvements for large content validation
- Better integration with workflow steps

**Next steps**:
- Add more educational content-specific validators
- Implement validator chaining for complex validation logic
- Add more unit tests and documentation

### 2. Remediation System Expansion

**Justification**: The remediation system should be enhanced to handle more complex content issues:
- Specialized remediation strategies for educational materials
- More sophisticated LLM-based remediation approaches
- Better feedback mechanisms for manual intervention

**Next steps**:
- Implement more specialized remediators for educational content
- Add LLM-guided remediation with improved prompting
- Create better logging and reporting for remediation actions

### 3. CLI and Web Interface

**Justification**: Better user interfaces will make the system more accessible:
- Enhanced CLI with more workflow management features
- Simple web interface for visualization and control
- Interactive workflow creation and monitoring

**Next steps**:
- Expand CLI to support all workflow operations
- Create a basic web dashboard
- Add visualization for workflow execution and results

## ðŸŒŸ Milestone Achieved: MVP Workflow

We have successfully implemented a minimum viable product workflow that can:
1. Generate complete educational modules including:
   - Course overview
   - Module outlines
   - Lecture content
   - Worksheets with activities
   - Assessments with various question types
   - Instructor guides with teaching suggestions
2. Validate content quality
3. Remediate issues automatically
4. Generate formatted output files
5. Track usage and costs

This MVP workflow demonstrates the core functionality of the system and provides a foundation for further development.
