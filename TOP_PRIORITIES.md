# Top 3 Implementation Priorities

Based on the project design and architecture, these are the three most critical components to implement first:

## 1. Prompt Registry

**Justification**: The Prompt Registry is the foundation of the system. It manages how prompts are stored, loaded, and accessed. Since the entire system revolves around prompt-centric content generation, having a robust prompt management system is essential before implementing other components. The registry enables:
- Loading prompts with their metadata
- Validating required variables
- Facilitating prompt reuse across workflows

**First steps**:
- Implement the PromptRegistry class (already started)
- Add unit tests for prompt loading and caching
- Create sample prompts for testing

## 2. LLM Integration Layer

**Justification**: The LLM Integration Layer is the primary interface to language models that generate all content. Implementing this component early provides:
- A unified API for working with multiple LLM providers
- Cost tracking and usage monitoring
- Retry and error handling capabilities
- Configurable model selection

**First steps**:
- Complete the LLMManager implementation
- Integrate LiteLLM for provider-agnostic API access
- Add proper error handling and retries
- Implement token counting and cost calculation

## 3. Workflow Engine

**Justification**: The Workflow Engine orchestrates the entire process, connecting all components together. It's the central nervous system of the application that:
- Manages the sequence of steps in content generation
- Handles context passing between steps
- Provides session management and persistence
- Implements error handling and recovery

**First steps**:
- Complete the Workflow and WorkflowStep classes
- Implement specific step types (PromptStep, ValidationStep, OutputStep)
- Add context management and session persistence
- Create a simple end-to-end workflow for testing

Once these three core components are functioning, the system will have a minimum viable implementation that can:
1. Load prompts with metadata
2. Send them to LLMs
3. Execute a basic workflow
4. Track usage and costs

These components provide the foundation upon which the rest of the system (validation, remediation, advanced output) can be built.
