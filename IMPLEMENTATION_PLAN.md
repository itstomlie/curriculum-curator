## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Approach
1. **Test-Driven**: Write tests for each new feature
2. **Incremental**: Deploy phases independently
3. **User-Centric**: Get feedback after each phase
4. **Documentation**: Update docs with each feature

### Technical Priorities
1. **Maintain Backwards Compatibility**: Don't break existing functionality
2. **Performance**: Monitor impact on generation speed
3. **Security**: Especially for web features and API keys
4. **Modularity**: Keep features decoupled where possible

### Resource Allocation
- **Solo Developer**: Focus on one phase at a time, ~6 months total
- **Small Team (2-3)**: Parallel work on phases, ~3-4 months total
- **Full Team (4+)**: Multiple phases concurrently, ~2-3 months total

### Success Metrics
- Phase 1: 90% successful import rate
- Phase 2: 50% reduction in content creation time
- Phase 3: 80% of users utilizing reference materials
- Phase 4: 30% improvement in pedagogical scores
- Phase 5: Support for 10+ session courses
- Phase 6: 25% reduction in token usage
- Phase 7: 40% increase in student engagement metrics
- Phase 8: 5+ institutional deployments

## Quick Wins (Can Do Anytime)
These can be implemented quickly between phases:
- [ ] Commit current uncommitted changes
- [ ] Add slide format customization (5-5-5 rule, etc.)
- [ ] Enable PDF import (basic text extraction)
- [ ] Add more pedagogical frameworks
- [ ] Create better error messages
- [ ] Improve UI/UX for existing features
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Create video tutorials

## Risk Mitigation
1. **Import Complexity**: Start with simple formats (Markdown) before Office
2. **Web Scope Creep**: Keep web version minimal initially
3. **Performance**: Monitor LLM costs and response times
4. **User Adoption**: Release phases to beta users first
5. **Technical Debt**: Allocate 20% time for refactoring

## Next Steps
1. Commit current changes (README, PDF export, etc.)
2. Start Phase 1.1: Add quick-xml to Cargo.toml
3. Set up testing framework for import functionality
4. Create a public roadmap for transparency
5. Establish feedback channels with users
