## Known Issues to Address

### Critical Console Errors
- ❌ `backupService` state not managed - Tauri service missing
- ❌ `get_backup_statistics` command not found  
- ❌ `list_backups` command not found
- ❌ `get_backup_config` command not found

### Expected Placeholder Behavior
- ⚠️ Expert Mode workflow steps are UI-only
- ⚠️ Batch processing has no backend implementation  
- ⚠️ Advanced export formats are stubs
- ⚠️ External LLM providers return errors

## Test Execution Instructions

### Running Tests
1. Start the application: `npm run dev`
2. Follow test scenarios in `TESTING.md`
3. Update this file with results using these status codes:

### Status Codes
- ✅ **PASS**: Works as expected, no issues
- ⚠️ **PARTIAL**: Works with limitations or minor issues
- ❌ **FAIL**: Broken, not working, or major issues
- 🔄 **Not Tested**: Awaiting test execution
- 🚧 **BLOCKED**: Cannot test due to dependencies

### Result Update Format
```markdown
| Test Name | ✅ PASS | Worked perfectly | 2025-01-19 |
| Test Name | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Works but shows console error | 2025-01-19 |
| Test Name | ❌ FAIL | Button doesn't respond | 2025-01-19 |
```

## Testing Priority

### Phase 1 (Immediate)
1. UI/UX Testing - Verify all interfaces work
2. Database Operations - Confirm data persistence
3. Fix console errors - Register missing Tauri services

### Phase 2 (Next)
1. Ollama LLM Integration - Test with local Ollama
2. File Operations - Verify import/export functionality
3. PowerPoint Export - Should already work

### Phase 3 (Later)
1. External LLM Providers - Implement real integrations
2. Expert Mode Workflows - Make functional
3. Advanced Features - Implement placeholders
