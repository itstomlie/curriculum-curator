# Curriculum Curator - Tauri Implementation

A desktop-first, privacy-focused tool for generating weekly educational content using AI. Built with Tauri for native performance and user experience.

## Project Status: Phase 2 - PRD Creation

This project is currently in the PRD (Product Requirements Document) creation phase using a structured 3-step development methodology.

### Development Phases

1. ‚úÖ **Phase 1: Knowledge Extraction & Archive** - Complete
   - Extracted valuable insights from Python/Electron implementation
   - Archived original code to `reference/` directory
   - Created comprehensive reference documentation

2. üîÑ **Phase 2: PRD Creation** - In Progress
   - Using structured ai-dev-tasks methodology
   - Deep thinking and clarifying questions process
   - Building comprehensive PRD for Tauri implementation

3. ‚è≥ **Phase 3: Tauri Implementation** - Pending
   - Systematic task-by-task development
   - Following generated task list with approval checkpoints

## Reference Materials

The `/reference/` directory contains comprehensive materials from the original implementation:

- **Architecture insights** and proven design patterns
- **High-value prompt templates** for educational content
- **Validation/remediation plugin concepts** that worked well
- **Workflow engine patterns** and configuration examples
- **LLM integration strategies** with cost tracking
- **Lessons learned** and pitfalls to avoid

## Technology Vision

### Target Stack
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript
- **Backend**: Rust (via Tauri)
- **Database**: SQLite (embedded)
- **UI Framework**: Tauri native components
- **Architecture**: Desktop-first, offline-capable

### Key Requirements
- **Weekly content focus** (not full curriculum)
- **Privacy-first approach** (local processing)
- **Native desktop performance** (sub-second startup)
- **Plugin architecture** for extensibility
- **Cost tracking** for LLM usage

## Getting Started

Currently in planning phase. Once the PRD is complete, development will begin following the systematic task-based methodology defined in `ai-dev-tasks/`.
